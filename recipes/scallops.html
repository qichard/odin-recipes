        <ul>
            <li>½ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>½ pound sea scallops</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Combine bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, olive oil, and parsley in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Cook bacon in a skillet over medium heat until golden but not crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Drain bacon fat from skillet until there is about 1 tablespoon fat left in the skillet. Add scallops and cook until golden brown, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes per side. Remove scallops from skillet.</li>
            <li>Wipe fat from skillet and add butter; cook and stir green bell pepper, onion, roasted red peppers, and garlic until fragrant and tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Add white wine; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add chicken broth and simmer for 1 minute; season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix bacon and scallops into bell pepper mixture and transfer to a baking dish; top with bread crumb mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 5 to 6 minutes. Turn on oven's broiler and broil until bread crumb mixture is lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
